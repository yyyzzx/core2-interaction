    <h3>WHAT IS BEEF HO-FUN?</h3>
    <p>Beef chow fun consists of tender, succulent beef slices; soft, springy rice noodles; crispy beansprouts and aromatic Chinese chives. It’s tasty, comforting and nutritious (protein, vegetable and starch in one plate). The Chinese name of this dish “干炒牛河” literally means “Dry fried beef and ho fun (a particular type of rice noodles)” As it suggests, the dish should look dry. That is to say, there shouldn’t be any excessive oil or sauce left on the plate when finished.</p>
    <p>It’s not a complicated task to cook this delightful dish at home. However, I’d like to share a few tips and tricks to help you have a fail-proof experience.</p>

    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <h5>FOR THE BEEF & MARINADE:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oz. flank steak (225g, sliced into <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> thick pieces)</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon baking soda (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>FOR THE REST OF THE DISH:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>12 oz. fresh wide rice noodles</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 scallions (split in half vertically and cut into 3-inch pieces)</li>
        <li>3 thin slices ginger</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons regular soy sauce</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> teaspoon sugar</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the beef and marinade ingredients and marinate for about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Some fresh rice noodles come as large sheets, while others are already cut. If you have the sheets, slice the rice noodles so they're about 1 inch wide. If the noodles are very stiff and stuck together, bring a wok full of water to a boil, and add the noodles. Blanch them for 30 seconds to loosen. Transfer to an ice bath and drain thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Heat your wok over high heat until smoking, and add 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tablespoons oil to coat the wok. Add the beef and sear until browned. As long as your wok is hot enough, the meat shouldn't stick. Set aside. Add 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tablespoons more vegetable oil to the wok. Add the ginger to infuse the oil with its rich flavor for about 15 seconds. Add the scallions.</li>
        <li>Spread the noodles evenly in the wok and stir-fry on high for about 15 seconds. Add the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok.</li>
        <li>Next, add the sesame oil, soy sauces, pinch of sugar and the seared beef. Stir-fry, making sure your metal wok spatula scrapes the bottom of the wok. Lift the noodles in an upward motion to mix well and coat them evenly with the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add a bit of salt and white pepper to taste (taste the noodles before adding salt). Add the bean sprouts and stir-fry until they are just tender. Serve!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>TIPS & NOTES</h3>
    <p>A useful tip is to freeze the beef before slicing, until it's firm but not solid. This makes slicing the beef much easier!
        <br>Important: Heat should remain as high as possible at all times when cooking this dish.
